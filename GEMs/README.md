# General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs)

The GEMs are a tool that you can use to convert data from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS and vice versa.

**Warning**

Update to warning/"Some context" below... it looks like GEMS may be gaining wider adoption, per this email from OHSU billing expert Jan Gollihur-Davidson. (It appears GEMS is the back-end data source for the system she refers to.)

Hi Stephanie, in a short amount of time I will be able to access a system that will convert ICD-9’s into ICD-10’s by range instead of individual codes. I can run the ranges through this system and it will put them on the spread sheet like this…I figure I will be able to learn and use it in a couple days. I can do this for you now if you like.  jan
